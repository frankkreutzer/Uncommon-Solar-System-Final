            <h1>Space Station</h1>

            <h3 class="craft-header">International Space Station (ISS)</h3>
            <p>
                The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, the last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and the station is expected to be used until 2028. Development and assembly of the station continues, with components scheduled for launch in 2018 and 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays, and other components. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.<br><br> The ISS serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and other fields. The station is suited for the testing of spacecraft systems and equipment required for missions to the Moon and Mars. The ISS maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435 km (205 and 270 mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the Zvezda module or visiting spacecraft. It completes 15.54 orbits per day.<br><br> The ISS programme is a joint project among five participating space agencies: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA. The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The station is divided into two sections, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the United States Orbital Segment (USOS), which is shared by many nations. As of January 2018, the American portion of ISS is being funded until 2025. Roscosmos has endorsed the continued operation of ISS through 2024 but has proposed using elements of the Russian Orbital Segment to construct a new Russian space station called OPSEK.

            <h1>Planetary Landers/Rovers</h1>

            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="craft-header">MSE lander</h3>
            <p>
                Scheduled to launch in October 2018 and expected to reach Mercury in December 2025, ESA's BepiColombo mission to Mercury originally included the Mercury Surface Element. The MSE lander would have carried a 7 kg payload consisting of an imaging system (a descent camera and a surface camera), a heat flow and physical properties package, an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer, a magnetometer, a seismometer, a soil penetrating device (mole), and a micro-rover. The MSE aspect of the mission was cancelled in 2003 due to budgetary constraints.
            </p>

            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="craft-header">Venera 7</h3>
            <p>
                First probe to return data from the surface of another planet (Venus) in 1970.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Venera 9</h3>
            <p>
                Soft landing on Venus, pictures of the surface 1975. (USSR) This was the first spacecraft to land on the surface of another planet.
            </p>

            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="craft-header">Viking 1</h3>
            <p>
                Viking 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975. The probe went into Martian orbit on June 19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Viking 2</h3>
            <p>
                Viking 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander, with the exception that its seismometer worked, recording one marsquake.<br> The last data from Viking (Lander 1) made its final transmission to Earth Nov. 11, 1982. Controllers at JPL tried unsuccessfully for another six and one-half months to regain contact with Viking Lander 1. The overall mission came to an end May 21, 1983.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Mars Rovers</h3>
            <p>
                There have been four successful robotically operated Mars rovers. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the Mars Pathfinder mission and its now inactive <strong>Sojourner rover</strong>. It currently manages the Mars Exploration Rover mission's active <strong>Opportunity rover</strong> and inactive <strong>Spirit</strong>, and, as part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, the <strong>Curiosity rover</strong>. On January 24, 2016 NASA reported that current studies on Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic, and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Mars 2, Mars 3, Beagle 2</strong> were all physically tethered probes, Sojourner was dependent on Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth, while MER-A & B, Curiosity, were on their own. Of these MER-B and Curiosity are still active, and MER-A and Sojourner completed their missions before losing contact in 2010 and 1997 respectively.

            <h2>Titan</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="craft-header">Huygens probe</h3>
            <p>
                The Huygens probe, carried to Saturn's moon Titan by the Cassini, was specifically designed to survive landing on land and on liquid. It was thoroughly drop-tested to make sure it could withstand impact and continue functioning for at least three minutes. However, due to the low speed impact, it continued providing data for more than two hours after it landed. The landing on Titan in 2005 was the first landing on planet's satellites outside the Moon.

            <h1>Satellites/Probes</h1>
            <hr>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Sputnik 1</h3>
            <p>
                Sputnik 1 was the first artificial Earth satellite. The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957, orbiting for three weeks before its batteries died, then silently for two more months before falling back into the atmosphere. It was a 58 cm (23 in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs, and the 65° inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth. This surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the Cold War. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Pioneer Venus</h3>
            <p>
                1978: Orbiter and four atmospheric probes; made the first high-quality map of the surface of Venus.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Voyager 1</h3>
            <p>
                Voyager 1 (image at top) was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March 5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. Voyager 2 was launched August 20, 1977 (before Voyager 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7, 1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and by Neptune on August 8, 1989. Voyager 2 took advantage of a rare once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet. Voyager 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto, but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.<br> Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their satellites, and their rings has become immense. Voyager 1 & 2 discovered that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.<br><br> When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas's appearance was startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance. The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids, kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Voyager 2</h3>
            <p>
                Voyager 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts, continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10 satellites and one more ring were discovered.<br> In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather, including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)<br><br> If no unforeseen failures occur, we will be able to maintain communications with both spacecraft until at least the year 2030. Both Voyagers have plenty of hydrazine fuel -- Voyager 1 is expected to have enough propellant until 2040 and Voyager 2 until 2034. The limiting factor is the RTGs (radio-isotope thermal generators). The power output from the RTGs is slowly dropping each year. By 2000, there won't be enough power for the UVS (ultraviolet spectrometer) instrument. By 2010, the power will have dropped low enough such that not all of the fields and particles instruments can be powered on at the same time. A power sharing plan will go into effect then, where some of the F & P instruments are powered on, and others off. The spacecraft can last in this mode for about another 10 years, and after that the power will probably be too low to maintain the spacecraft.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Vega</h3>
            <p>
                International project VENUS-HALLEY, launched in 1984, carried a Venus orbiter and lander and did a fly-by of Comet Halley.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Magellan</h3>
            <p>
                Launched in May 1989, Magellan has mapped 98% of the surface of Venus at better than 300 meter resolution and obtained a comprehensive gravity field map for 95 percent of the planet. Magellan recently executed an 80-day aerobraking program to lower and circularize its orbit. Magellan has completed its radar mapping and gravity data collection. In the fall of 1994, just before it would have failed due to deterioration in its solar panels, Magellan was deliberately sent into Venus' atmosphere to further study aerobraking techniques which can make major savings in fuel for future missions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Galileo</h3>
            <p>
                Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe. It made extensive surveys of the Jovian moons and the probe descended into Jupiter's atmosphere to provide our first direct evidence of the interior of a gas giant.<br> In addition, Galileo has returned the first resolved images of two asteroids, 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida, while in transit to Jupiter. It also returned pictures of the impact of Comet SL9 onto Jupiter from its unique vantage point.<br><br> Galileo was deliberately crashed in to Jupiter in 2003 to prevent any possibility that it might crash into Europa and contaminate any life that might be there.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Ulysses</h3>
            <p>
                Now investigating the Sun's polar regions (European Space Agency/NASA). Ulysses was launched by the Space Shuttle Discovery in October 1990. In February 1992, it got a gravity boost from Jupiter to take it out of the plane of the ecliptic. It has now completed its main mission of surveying both of the Sun's poles. Its mission has been extended for another orbit so that it can survey the Sun's poles near the maximum of the sunspot cycle, too. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is! It is expected to provide a much better understanding of the Sun's magnetic field and the solar wind.

            <h1>Telescopes</h1>
            <hr>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Hubble Space Telescope (1990)</h3>
            <p>
                The granddaddy of space telescopes, Hubble has been observing from Earth orbit for more than 19 years. Hubble, the first of NASA's Great Observatories, has revolutionized astronomy, providing stunning images of countless cosmic objects and giving astronomers their most distant views of the universe with the Hubble Deep Field and Ultra Deep Field. Hubble has shed light on the scale of the universe, the life cycle of stars, black holes, and the formation of the first galaxies. Currently receiving its fifth and final makeover, Hubble is expected to last at least another five years, hopefully overlapping with its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">James Webb Space Telescope (TBD)</h3>
            <p>
                The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope developed in collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency that will be the scientific successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The JWST will offer unprecedented resolution and sensitivity, and will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology. One of its major goals is observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies. These types of targets are beyond the reach of current ground and space-based instruments. Other goals include understanding the formation of stars and planets, and direct imaging of exoplanets and novas.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Kepler Mission (2009)</h3>
            <p>
                Also new to the space scene is Kepler, NASA's new planet-hunting telescope that will specifically be searching for other Earth-like planets in the galaxy. Kepler will be looking for characteristic variations in the light from a pre-selected target group of 100,000 stars. Dips in the light from the stars can indicate a planet passing in front of the star (from Earth's perspective). Astronomers are hoping that Kepler fill find planets in the stars' habitable zones, where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist. After getting settled into its new orbital home, Kepler officially began its search in May. First light from the telescope came on April 16.
            </p>

            <h3 class="craft-header">Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer (2004)</h3>
            <p>
                Swift scans the sky for gamma rays, specifically looking for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most powerful explosions in the universe. GRBs flash for just a few seconds before sliding into an afterglow of X-ray, ultraviolet and visible light. Swift can detect a GRB and within a minute point itself at the event for quick observations, with its instruments following along as the burst's light moves through the spectrum. In 2007, Swift spotted a GRB with the longest lived afterglow yet recorded, more than 125 days. Swift has also recorded the most distant cosmic explosion ever seen, a gamma-ray burst from a star that died when the universe was only 630 million years old, or less than 5 percent of its present age.
