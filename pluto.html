                        <!--<p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>-->

                        <p>In this article we will discuss the resoning of why pluto is no longer described as a planet of our solar system.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h2>Where Did the Controversy Start?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pluto was discovered in 1930 by US astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who was using the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Textbooks were swiftly updated to list this ninth member in the club. But over subsequent decades, astronomers began to wonder whether Pluto might simply be the first of a population of small, icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This region would become known as the Kuiper Belt, but it took until 1992 for the first "resident" to be discovered. The candidate Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) 1992 QBI was detected by David Jewitt and colleagues using the University of Hawaii's 2.24m telescope at Mauna Kea.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How Did This Change Things?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Confirmation of the first KBO invigorated the existing debate. And in 2000, the Hayden Planetarium in New York became a focus for controversy when it unveiled an exhibit featuring only eight planets. The planetarium's director Neil deGrasse Tyson would later become a vocal figure in public discussions of Pluto's status.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But it was discoveries of Kuiper Belt Objects with masses roughly comparable to Pluto, such as Quaoar (announced in 2002), Sedna (2003) and Eris (2005), that pushed the issue to a tipping point. Eris, in particular, appeared to be larger than Pluto - giving rise to its informal designation as the Solar System's "tenth planet".
                        </p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            Prof Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), who led the team that found Eris, would later style himself as the "man who killed Pluto", while deGrasse Tyson would later jokingly quip that he had "driven the getaway car".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The finds spurred the International Astronomical Union to set up a committee tasked with defining just what constituted a planet, with the aim of putting a final draft proposal before members at the IAU's 2006 General Assembly in Prague.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Under a radical early plan, the number of planets would have increased from nine to 12, seeing Pluto and its moon Charon recognised as a twin planet, and Ceres and Eris granted entry to the exclusive club. But the idea met with opposition.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Reasoning</h2>
                        <p>
                            The discussions in Prague during August 2006 were intense, but a new version of a planetary definition gradually took shape. On 24 August, the last day of the assembly, members voted to adopt a new resolution outlining criteria for naming a planet:
                        </p>

                        <figure class="figure">
                            <img src="images/pluto/pluto-fig2.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Image of the planet criteria.">
                            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">Image of the planet criteria.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            Pluto met the first two of the these criteria, but the last one proved pivotal. "Clearing the neighbourhood" means that the planet has either "vacuumed up" or ejected other large objects in its vicinity of space. In other words, it has achieved gravitational dominance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was immediately relegated it to the distinct category of "dwarf planet", alongside the biggest body in the asteroid belt, Ceres, and other large Kuiper Belt Objects such as Eris, Quaoar and Sedna.
                        </p>

                        </figure>

                        <h2>So Then, What is Pluto?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pluto is a dwarf planet. A dwarf planet travels around, or orbits, the sun just like other planets. But it is much smaller.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Pluto is not very big. It is only half as wide as the United States. Pluto is smaller than Earth's moon. This dwarf planet takes 248 Earth years to go around the sun. If you lived on Pluto, you would have to wait 248 Earth years to celebrate your first birthday. One day on Pluto is about 6 1/2 days on Earth.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Pluto is about 40 times farther from the sun than Earth is. Pluto is in an area of space called the Kuiper (KY-per) Belt. Thousands of small, icy objects like Pluto but smaller are in the Kuiper Belt.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This dwarf planet has five moons. Its largest moon is named Charon (KAIR-ən). Charon is about half the size of Pluto. Pluto's four other moons are named Kerberos, Styx, Nix and Hydra.
                        </p>
