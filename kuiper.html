            <h2 class "contentHeaders">The Kuiper Belt</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond the gas giant Neptune lies a region of space filled with icy bodies. Known as the Kuiper Belt, this chilly expanse holds trillions of objects, remnants of the early solar system. Dutch astronomer Jan Oort first proposed in 1950 that some comets might come from the solar system's far suburbs. That reservoir later became known as the Oort Cloud. Earlier, in 1943, astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth had suggested comets and larger bodies might exist beyond Neptune. In 1951, astronomer Gerard Kuiperpredicted the existence of a belt of icy objects that now bears his name. Some astronomers refer to it as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt.
            </p>

            <p>
                Astronomers are now hunting in the Kuiper Belt for a so-called "Planet Nine," a hypothetical world in the Kuiper Belt, after evidence of its existence was unveiled on Jan. 20, 2016. It is thought to be about 10 times the mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto.

            <!-- Start Formation Section -->
            <h2 class="contentHeaders">Kuiper Belt Formation</h2>
            <p>
                When the solar system formed, much of the gas, dust and rocks pulled together to form the sun and planets. The planets then swept most of the remaining debris into the sun or out of the solar system. But bodies farther out remained safe from gravitational tugs of planets like Jupiter, and so managed to stay safe as they slowly orbited the sun. The Kuiper Belt and its compatriot, the more distant and spherical Oort Cloud, contain the leftover remnants from the beginning of the solar system and can provide valuable insights into its birth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model" target="_blank">Nice model</a>, the Kuiper Belt may have formed closer to the sun, near where Neptune now orbits. In this model, the planets engaged in an elaborate dance, with Neptune and Uranus changing places and moving outward, away from the sun. They may have carried the Kuiper Belt objects with them, shepherding them ahead as they migrated.
            </p>

            <p>
                The classical Kuiper Belt — the most crowded section — lies between 42 and 48 times Earth's distance from the sun. The orbit of objects in this region remain stable for the most part, although some objects occasionally have their course changed slightly when they drift too close to Neptune.
            </p>

            <!-- Start Composition Section -->
            <h2 class="contentHeaders">Composition</h2>
            <p>
                The Kuiper Belt is an elliptical plane in space spanning from 30 to 55 times Earth's distance from the sun, or 2.5 to 4.5 billion miles (4.5 to 7.4 billion kilometers). The belt is similar to the asteroid belt found between Mars and Jupiter, although the objects in the Kuiper Belt tend more to be icy rather than rocky.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scientists estimate that thousands of bodies more than 100 km (62 miles) in diameter travel around the sun within this belt, along with trillions of smaller objects, many of which are short-period comets. The region also contains several dwarf planets — round worlds too large to be considered asteroids and yet not qualifying as planets because they're too small, on an odd orbit, and don't clear out the space around them the way the eight planets do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite its massive size, the Kuiper Belt wasn't discovered until 1992 by Dave Jewitt and Jane Luu. According to NASA, the pair had been "doggedly scanning the heavens in search of dim objects beyond Neptune" since 1987. They dubbed the first object they spotted "Smiley" but it was later cataloged as "1992 QB1."

            <h2>Kuiper Belt Objects</h2>
            <p>
                Pluto was the first true Kuiper Belt object (KBO) to be seen, although scientists at the time didn't recognize it as such. The existence of the belt wasn't realized until Jewitt and Luu discovered a slow-moving, small world in the outer solar system. Other objects were soon discovered, and astronomers quickly saw that the region beyond Neptune teemed with icy rocks and tiny worlds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sedna, about three-fourths the size of Pluto, was discovered in 2004. It is so far out from the sun it takes about 10,500 years to make a single orbit. Sedna is about 1,100 miles (1,770 km) wide and circles the sun on an eccentric orbit that ranges between 8 billion miles (12.9 billion km) and 84 billion miles (135 billion km).
            </p>

            <p>
                In July 2005, astronomers announced the discovery of an object in the Kuiper Belt thought to be larger than Pluto, though subsequent observations revealed it was slightly smaller. Known as Eris, it orbits the sun approximately once every 580 years, traveling almost one hundred times farther from the sun than Earth does. Eris' discovery revealed to some astronomers the problem of terming Pluto a full-scale planet, and in 2006, Pluto, Eris, and the largest asteroid, Ceres, were reclassified as dwarf planets. Two more dwarf planets, Haumea and Makemake, were discovered in the Kuiper Belt in 2008.

            <h2>Kuipter Belt Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Kuiper Belt could contain hundreds of thousands of icy bodies that range in size from small chunks of ice to worldlets larger than 100 kilometres across.
                </li>
                <li>
                    SoThe largest Kuiper Belt Objects are Pluto, Quaoar, Makemake, Haumea, Ixion, and Varuna. These are often also referred to as Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs).
                </li>
                <li>
                    There could be more than a trillion comet nuclei in the main body of the Kuiper Belt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first mission to the Kuiper Belt and beyond flew by Pluto in July 2015. It’s called New Horizons and will survey Pluto, Charon and the other moons before heading out to study other Kuiper Belt Objects in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ices in the Kuiper Belt date back to the formation of the solar system. They contain clues to conditions in the early solar nebula.
