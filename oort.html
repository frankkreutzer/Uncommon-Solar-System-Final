            <h2 class "contentHeaders">What is the Oort Cloud?</h2>
            <p>
                The Oort Cloud is an extended shell of icy objects that exist in the outermost reaches of the solar system. It is named after astronomer Jan Oort, who first theorised its existence. The Oort Cloud is roughly spherical, and is thought to be the origin of most of the long-period comets that have been observed.
            </p>

            <p>
                This cloud of particles is theorized to be the remains of the disc of material that formed the Sun and planets. Astronomers now refer to those primeval objects as a protoplanetary disk. The most likely theory is that the material now in the Oort Cloud probably formed closer to the young Sun in the earliest epochs of solar system formation. As the planets grew, and in particular as Jupiter coalesced and migrated to its present position, its gravitational influence is thought to have scattered many icy objects out to their present position in the Oort cloud.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Oort Cloud is very distant from the Sun and it can be disrupted by the nearby passage of a star, nebula, or by actions in the disk of the Milky Way. Those actions knock cometary nuclei out of their orbits, and send them on a headlong rush toward the Sun.
            </p>

            <p>
                The inner limits of the Oort Cloud begin at about 2,000 AU from the Sun. The cloud itself stretches out almost a quarter of the way to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri. It is spherically shaped and consists of an outer cloud and a torus (doughnut-shaped) inner cloud.
            </p>

            <!-- Start Composition Section -->
            <h2 class="contentHeaders">Oort Cloud Composition</h2>
            <p>
                The estimated 2 trillion objects in the Oort Cloud are primarily composed of ices such as ammonia, methane, and water. Formed in the beginning of the solar system, they remain pristine chunks of its early life, allowing comets to provide insight into the environment in which the early Earth evolved. While gravity drew other bits of dust and ice together into larger celestial bodies, the residents of the Oort Cloud weren't as fortunate. Gravity from the other planets—primarily gas giants such as Jupiter — kicked them into the outer solar system, where they remain.
            </p>

            <p>
                The population of the Oort Cloud is in a constant state of flux. Not only are some of its residents permanently booted out of the system through interactions with passing neighbors, the sun may also capture the inhabitants from the shells surrounding other stars. Some of the bodies plunging toward the sun may have been kidnapped early in the sun's evolution, when it was part of a more closely-packed cluster of stars.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two types of comets travel through the solar system. Those with short periods, on the order of a few hundred years, stem from the Kuiper Belt, a pancake of icy particles near the orbit of Pluto. Longer period comets, with orbits of thousands of years, come from the more distant Oort Cloud.
            </p>

            <p>
                The two regions vary primarily in terms of distance and location. The Kuiper Belt orbits in approximately the same plane as the planets, ranging from 30 to 50 times as far from the Sun as Earth. But the Oort Cloud is a shell that surrounds the entire solar system, and is a hundred times as distant.

            <!-- Start Comets Section -->
            <h2 class="contentHeaders">The Oort Cloud and Comets</h2>
            <p>
                Comets from the Oort Cloud can travel as far as three light-years from the sun. The farther they go, the weaker the sun's gravitational hold grows. Passing stars and clouds of molecular gas can easily change the orbit of these comets, stripping them from our star or casting them back toward it. The path of the comets is constantly shifting, depending on what factors influence it.
            </p>

            <p>
                When the comet Hyakutake passed within 9 million miles (15 million kilometers) of Earth in 1996, it was completing a journey of about 17,000 years from the distant reaches of the Oort Cloud. Hale-Bopp was another long-period comet that traveled in from the Oort Cloud. Visible for nearly a year and a half, it passed within 122 million miles (197 million kilometers) of the Earth. Both of these Oort Cloud objects had their orbits drastically changed as a result of their pass through the solar system. Halley's Comet is also believed to have originally come from the Oort Cloud, although it is now a Kuiper Belt object.

            <h2>Oort Cloud Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Objects in the Oort Cloud are also referred to as Trans-Neptunian objects. This name also applies to objects in the Kuiper Belt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some astronomers theorise that the Sun may have captured Oort Cloud cometary material from the outer disks of other stars that were forming in the same nebula as our star.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Oort Cloud is a reserve of cometary nuclei that contain ices dating back to the origin of the solar system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No one knows for sure how many objects exist in the Oort Cloud, but most estimates put it at around 2 trillion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Astronomers think that long-period comets (those with orbital periods longer than 200 years) have their origins in the Oort Cloud.
